Overview

This project involves the development of a chatbot using Python and natural language processing techniques. The chatbot is implemented within a Jupyter notebook and leverages libraries such as NLTK, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow/Keras to provide responses based on user input. Additionally, the chatbot integrates with the Telegram platform, allowing interaction through the Telegram messaging application.

Features

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Utilizes tokenization, lemmatization, and bag-of-words techniques.

Machine Learning Model: Implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify user inputs into appropriate response categories.

Interactive Chat Interface: Simple, interactive interface within Jupyter Notebook for real-time interaction with the chatbot.

Telegram Integration: Enables chatbot accessibility via the Telegram messaging platform.
